# ACM
Army Composition Mod for Victoria 2
(Intended to work with HPM)

---

# Notes

## Day 1
- Ensure that the beginning troops of each nation are appropriate for the technology level, soldier pops, and supplies of the nation

## Technology
- Ensure that technology upgrades appropriately upgrade each army composition stats
- Ensure that nations cannot build armies without all required technologies (i.e. artillery unlocked for an army with artillery

## Army Goods Supplies
- Ensure that the goods required for each army make sense based on the composition

## Map Supply Limits
- Ensure that the supply limit of the army makes sense for the map

## Soldier Pops
- Ensure that the amount of soldier pops required for an army make sense
- Ensure that the amount of armies allowed to be created based on the number of soldier pops available makes sense

## Mobilization
- How does mobilization look in a format like this?
- Possibly avoid normal mobilization in favor of heavily increased reinforcement rates of existing armies
